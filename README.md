# skidware-hub
A quick script hub I made, had multiple scripts that are related to scripts such as "Super Parts V4", but with my scripts, they are much more different.

- Skidware Hub -
 Multi Tool Utility

- What does it have? -
  Contains over 20 scripts that I'm working on!
  A pretty decent hub, not the best.

- What do the scripts do -
   Each script is different and each script also brings parts similar to super parts v4, but what's different is how it's formed, and it's size, there all different and cool!

- Is this safe? -
  Yes it is safe, and the only reason the code is obfuscated it to protect the code from being stolen, it's really easy to create anyway.
  If you don't trust the script and need further proof, add me and I will show the code, I do not gain nothing if I were to add anything malicious.

- How do I use it? -
  Copy the script, and paste it into your executor, the script works on any executor as well.

- What games does it work on? -
  It works on any game, but on games where the parts have to be unanchored such as:
  . Work at a Pizza Place
  . Sword Fighting Tycoon
  . Natural Disasters [Not working]
  . And many more!


  - That's really it, I was bored and just decided to do this, and the script is keyless so enjoy.
